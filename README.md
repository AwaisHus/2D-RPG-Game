I've developed a Java-based 2D RPG Game framework that boasts a wide array of features and methods, designed to provide a comprehensive gaming experience. This framework empowers you with the tools to accomplish tasks such as level generation, character movement, transitioning between levels, and initiating basic interactions with formidable enemies.

To make this possible, I've meticulously structured the framework using an object-oriented approach. This decision ensures that you can effortlessly customize the entire game by simply tweaking a few key values. The program code at the heart of this framework incorporates several crucial components, including:

Random Number Generation (RNG) Modifier: This versatile modifier influences various aspects of the game, from generating walls to altering the layout of staircases for level transitions, dictating monster behavior, and controlling their movements.
Monster Behavior and Quantity Customization: You have the flexibility to adjust how monsters behave and populate the game world according to your preferences.
Healthbar Options: Customize the health bar to suit your game's specific requirements, allowing you to fine-tune the player's health management.
Dynamic Sprite Generation: The framework efficiently generates sprites, linking them to their respective variables, ensuring that your game's visual elements align with your vision.
The current capabilities of the game are quite impressive. As a player, you can:

Navigate the Game World: Take control of your character and explore the game world with smooth and responsive movement.
Combat Enemies: Engage in thrilling battles by colliding with monsters or standing adjacent to them. You have the power to initiate attacks and fend off these foes.
Dynamic Enemy AI: Watch as monsters pursue you intelligently, becoming increasingly aggressive as you ascend through levels. They'll chase you relentlessly or cover more ground as the game progresses, making each encounter more challenging.
Level Transitions: Progress through the game by ascending to new levels, where the stair tile that transports you changes with each level. This feature adds an exciting layer of unpredictability.
Rogue-like Variety: Experience a unique playthrough every time you start the game. The RNG ensures that no two levels are the same, capturing the essence of the roguelike genre.
Risk of Defeat: Keep an eye on your health, as taking too much damage from monsters can lead to your health reaching zero and result in a game over.
In summary, this Java-based 2D RPG Game framework offers a rich set of features, making it a versatile platform for crafting engaging and dynamic games. Its object-oriented design and customizable elements empower developers to create unique gaming experiences while maintaining a sense of challenge and unpredictability, characteristic of the roguelike genre.
